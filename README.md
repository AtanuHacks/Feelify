# 🌈 Feelify — Where Emotions Design Your Interface

*A No-Code AI Project for TECHNOVA 2025*

---

## 🧠 Overview

*Feelify* is an AI-powered emotion detection and adaptive UI system that makes digital interfaces respond to human moods.  
By using facial expressions, tone of voice, or user input, Feelify transforms interface themes, layouts, and colors in real time — creating a truly *empathetic user experience*.

> "When technology understands how you feel, interaction becomes emotion-driven."
